<h1>Delores Washington</h1>
<p>I was born in Washington, DC, where I nurtured my musical ambitions. I participated in marching and performance band, so i sought to become a sound engineer. Although I thought music production was easier because I learned to read and compose music, engineering was more lucrative. I felt as if the freelance market for music production was applicable whenever I wanted to dabble in the space. Investing in any degree takes a certain level of ambition, so you must make the best decisions for your set goals.
    <p>As of today, <strong>sound engineering is still my skill set. </strong> However, I have decided to focus on Digital media and web technology. The world is changing, and I appreciate the opportunity to change along with the world in the best way possible. This degree program facilitates growth in a field of my interest. I am currently building my own production company. I am excited about the promising path ahead for my company's growth. With an engineering background and a new program, such as web technology, I will forge ahead.  
        <p> 

            In the future, becoming proficient at website development, whether front-end or back-end, and acquiring a sound understanding of the forward-thinking tech landscape, I look forward to highlighting that I have honed my tech skillfulness. Also, my company will operate within <em>several government contracts.</em> These are the goals I will spend my days working towards. It takes time I know, so in ten years I believe the goals I set will come to fruition.</p>
